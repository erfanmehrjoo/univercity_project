## About:
***Tic Tac Toe or Noughts and Crosses*** as called in British is a pencil and paper game for two player. The player who succed in placing three of their marks in a single line either horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game. In this Repository I make the game using Tkinter in Python. Here two human are playing against each other and the first one to go gets "X" and the second one gets "O".Tkinter is a GUI framework for Python that allows for buttons, graphics and alot of other things to be done in a window
